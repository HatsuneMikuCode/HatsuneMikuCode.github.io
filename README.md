# Hatsune Miku's Website
This is my website/blog/Roku channel feed. The only reason it's public is that it's a GitHub Pages website so it has to be public.
# Copying
You can copy, **although** you need to manualy delete any info on the page relating to the website itself and the `feed` folder as that is the Roku feed. You can also copy the `noinfo` folder, for a version which is like a template of the main website.
