# Controversy Surrounds Glitch Productions’ “Murder Drones” Over Language Concerns

In a recent turn of events, Glitch Productions, the creators of the animated series “Murder Drones,” have come under fire from concerned parents over the use of the word “murder” in the title of their TV-14 rated show. The series, which has gained a significant following for its blend of horror, black comedy, and science fiction elements, is now at the center of a heated debate regarding age-appropriate content.


The controversy began when a parent, who wishes to remain anonymous, expressed outrage over the show’s title, arguing that the word “murder” is too explicit for a program accessible to young teenagers. The parent’s concern is that the title may desensitize children to the gravity of the act implied by the word.


“Murder Drones,” which premiered on YouTube on October 29, 2021, is set in the year 3071 on an exoplanet owned by a megacorporation. The plot revolves around autonomous robots, known as Worker Drones, who are left to survive in a harsh environment after a catastrophic event wipes out biological life on the planet. The arrival of the Disassembly Drones, nicknamed “Murder Drones,” introduces a violent struggle for survival, with the protagonist, Uzi Doorman, leading the narrative.


Glitch Productions has not yet responded to the criticism but has previously stated that the show aims to explore complex themes through its animated narrative. The series has been praised for its animation quality, voice acting, and world-building, and was even nominated for a Webby Award in the category of Best Animated Video.


As the debate continues, it raises important questions about content rating systems and the responsibility of creators in titling their works. The discussion also highlights the challenges of balancing creative expression with audience sensitivities, especially in an age where digital content is widely accessible to diverse age groups.


For now, “Murder Drones” remains available for viewing, and it is up to parents and guardians to decide what is suitable for their children to watch. The conversation around the series is a reminder of the ongoing dialogue between content creators, regulators, and the public on the evolving standards of entertainment media.
