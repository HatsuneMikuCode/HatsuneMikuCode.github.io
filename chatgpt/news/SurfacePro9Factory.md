# Bloody Surface Pro 9 Shipped to Unsuspecting Customer

A customer in Seattle, Washington received the shock of a lifetime when they opened their brand new Microsoft Surface Pro 9 and discovered blood stains on the device. The customer, who has asked to remain anonymous, reported the incident to Microsoft and the police immediately.

According to the customer, the blood stains were not limited to just the device, but also on the packaging and paperwork included in the box. They stated, "I couldn't believe it, it was like something out of a horror movie. There were smears of blood all over the place. I couldn't shake the feeling that it was still warm to the touch. It was so disturbing, I couldn't even bring myself to turn it on."

Upon further investigation, Microsoft discovered that the blood stains were the result of a murder that occurred at the factory where the Surface Pro 9 was manufactured. A statement from the company reads, "We are deeply troubled by this incident and extend our sincerest apologies to the affected customer. We have launched a full investigation into the matter and are working closely with local authorities."

The police have confirmed that the murder occurred in the early hours of the morning on the day the Surface Pro 9 in question was assembled. The victim has been identified as a factory worker, and the suspect is still at large. The police have released a security camera footage of the suspect in the factory, wearing a Microsoft lab coat and moving stealthily in the dark. This footage has left many people worried about the safety of their workplace.

Customers who have recently purchased a Surface Pro 9 are urged to check their device for any unusual stains or markings. Microsoft is offering full refunds and replacements to any affected customers. However, many are hesitant to return their devices, scared to know where the blood might have come from.

This disturbing incident has raised serious concerns about the safety and security of factory workers and the potential contamination of consumer products. Microsoft has assured customers that they are taking all necessary measures to prevent such incidents from happening in the future, but the thought of a murderer on the loose in the factory where their device was made, has left many people paranoid.

The police are urging anyone with information about the murder or the suspect to come forward. In the meantime, the factory where the Surface Pro 9 was manufactured has been closed for the investigation. The investigation team has found some clues that the murder was a premeditated crime, but the suspect's identity and motive still remain unknown.

As the investigation continues, the police have identified that the victim was a woman who had been working at the factory for the past 5 years. She had no known enemies and her colleagues describe her as a friendly and hardworking person. The police believe that the suspect knew her and had planned the murder for a long time. This theory is further reinforced by the fact that the security cameras were tampered with and some footage from the night of the murder is missing.

The police are currently interviewing the victim's colleagues and friends, trying to find a lead to the suspect's identity. They have also increased the security at the factory, making sure that the killer doesn't come back to the scene of the crime.
