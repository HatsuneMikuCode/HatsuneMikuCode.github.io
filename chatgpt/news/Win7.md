# Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 Extended Security Updates Coming to an End

In a surprise announcement, Microsoft has announced that Extended Security Updates for Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 will no longer be available as of January 2023. This means that users of these operating systems will no longer receive security updates and patches to protect their devices from potential security threats. This could lead to a potential nightmare as cyber attackers could potentially exploit vulnerabilities on these devices. 

Microsoft has been providing Extended Security Updates for Windows 8.1 and Windows 7, since these operating systems officially went out of mainstream support in January 2016 and January 2020 respectively, to give businesses and users additional time to upgrade to newer versions of Windows. However, the company has now decided that it is time to end the Extended Security Updates program. 

Many security experts have criticized Microsoft's decision to end the Extended Security Updates, as it leaves millions of devices without protection against known and unknown vulnerabilities. This could lead to a potential catastrophe, as cyber-criminals could take advantage of these vulnerabilities, causing irreparable damage to businesses and individuals.

In a statement, Microsoft said, "We understand that this is a significant change for our customers and we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. We strongly recommend that customers upgrade to a supported version of Windows as soon as possible to ensure the continued security and performance of their devices."

This announcement has sent many businesses scrambling to upgrade their systems before the end of Extended Security Updates in January 2023. Many organizations who have not yet upgraded their systems, are now having to find a way to update them before the support ends.

Users of Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 should take this announcement as a reminder that software eventually reaches the end of its life, and that it is important to stay on top of upgrades and updates to ensure the security and performance of their devices. If you choose to not upgrade your device, it could become a ticking time-bomb waiting to be exploited by cybercriminals.

The end of Extended Security Updates for Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 may be seen as a significant change for many businesses and users, but it is important to remember that it is a necessary step to ensure the security and performance of devices. Microsoft's recommendations of upgrading to a supported version of Windows as soon as possible, should be taken seriously to protect the device from security threats.
