# NoEscape.exe Virus Devastates Glubo Company

A highly sophisticated computer virus created by Russian YouTuber Enderman has successfully taken down the systems of Glubo, a leading technology company.

According to sources close to the company, the virus, dubbed NoEscape.exe, was able to infiltrate Glubo's network and immediately change the username and profile picture of all infected devices to a red version of the default Windows 10 account picture and the phrase "NO ESCAPE".

Employees first became aware of the virus when they received a chilling message on their screens that read: "THERE IS NO ESCAPE NOW. DO NOT TRY TO CLOSE THIS WINDOW, YOUR COMPUTER IS NOW DONE FOR ANYWAY. DO YOU WANT TO ENJOY THE LAST MINUTES USING YOUR COMPUTER?"

The virus then proceeded to delete the Boot Configuration Data (BCD) of all affected devices, rendering them completely inoperable. In addition, the virus had the ability to spread to other devices on the same network, causing widespread damage throughout the company.

Glubo's IT team worked tirelessly to try and contain the virus, but it had spread too far and caused too much damage. The company was forced to shut down all operations as they worked to restore their systems.

Enderman, the creator of the virus, is still at large and authorities are currently investigating the attack. It is believed that the virus was created specifically to target Glubo, but it is not yet known what the motivations behind the attack were.

Glubo has released a statement urging all employees and customers to update their antivirus software and be cautious when opening emails or downloading attachments from unknown sources. The company is working with leading cybersecurity experts to fully assess the damage caused by the attack and to secure their systems to prevent any future attacks.
