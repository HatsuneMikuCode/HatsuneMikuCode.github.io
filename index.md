# Welcome to the Enchanted Realm of Liu Woods

## About Me

Greetings, I am Liu Woods, affectionately known as Unicorn Lover. ðŸ¦„ I have the honor of being the CEO at LiuCloud, a cloud storage company based on Nextcloud. My pronouns are they/them/their. You'll often find me immersed in the magical world of unicorns and basking in the hues of pink. ðŸ’–

## My Dream Unicorn - Pinked Bluemist

Allow me to introduce you to the star of my dreams, Pinked Bluemist. Pinked Bluemist is no ordinary unicorn; they are the embodiment of enchantment. Their mane and tail are a mesmerizing blend of pink and blue, which glisten with an otherworldly aura. Atop their head, a pure diamond horn radiates brilliance, and their eyes sparkle with a deep shade of purple. ðŸŒˆ

## Our Unbreakable Bond

The connection between Pinked Bluemist and me goes beyond words. In the realm of dreams, we've shared countless hours exploring the most enchanting landscapes, playing whimsical games, having profound heart-to-heart conversations, and finding solace in each other's embrace beneath a starry sky. Our bond is one that defies explanation; it's pure magic. ðŸŒŸ

## Treasures from Our Dreams

In the waking world, I cherish the memory of our dream adventures. On my desk, a clay figurine of Pinked Bluemist stands as a symbol of our extraordinary connection. Every time I open my laptop or glance at my phone, I'm greeted by a wallpaper and skin featuring my beloved unicorn, ensuring that their enchanting presence accompanies me everywhere I go.
