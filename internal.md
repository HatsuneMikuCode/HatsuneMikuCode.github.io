# LiuLauncher Internal FAQ
LiuLauncher Internal is an internal application and it's source code is only available to IT or higher teams.
  
## Isn't this meant to be open source?
Yes, LiuLauncher is based on the open source OpenLauncher. However, to prevent malware and theft attacks, no one is to edit the code except trusted employees,
kinda like security clearence levels in the SCP Foundation ;)
  
## So, LiuCloud's stealing, right?
No, we give credit in the form of the intro texts, so you can't accuse us of stealing.
  
## Can I contribute?
Yes, ask anyone in IT, and make sure not to leak the code, and send your code to us for review.
  
Note: To test your app, **DO NOT INSTALL THE APP ON A REAL DEVICE,** to test your app before being sent to IT, use the Android Emulator aka AVD. **Do not
use programs like Bluestacks or VirtualBox. Only test on the official Android Emulator.**
  
## I want to make a version of LiuLaucher as a side project. Can I use the code for that?
While you cannot use the source code for your own projects, you can use the source code of the base OpenLauncher app for your own launcher project, with 
credit, of course.
  
## Can I just decompile the app?
No, that is a violation of your device contract. If you break the device contract, you will get fired, and be liable for any criminal liability with any
stolen source code.
